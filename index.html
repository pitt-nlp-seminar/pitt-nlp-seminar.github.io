					<p><b>Bio:</b> Rachel Coelho is jointly appointed as a Research Scientist at the Learning Research and Development Center.

					<p><b>Title:</b> Conversational Dynamics with Large Language Model-powered Chatbots: Unknown Unknowns, Suspended Conclusions, and Benefits 
					<p><b>Abstract:</b> This study focuses on learner reports about learning conversations to understand differences in conversation dynamics between LLM chatbots and familiar human interactions. Sociocultural theory argues talk-in-interaction between humans facilitates knowledge construction. LLM-powered chatbots are hypothesized to enhance learner meaning-making and knowledge construction. For working on lab session multiple-choice tests (MCTs), 96 students were assigned to one of three conditions: no support, peer support, or ChatGPT support. After five MCTs, they self-selected into a different group for the remaining MCTs. We focus on reflections of 11 students from follow-up semi-structured interviews who experienced both ChatGPT and peer support. Three key themes emerged. First, students observed a Problem Detection Gap: that ChatGPT cannot detect misunderstandings unless explicitly told, unlike peers or teachers. Humans engage in mutual elaboration using talk and their environment  to convey understanding and identify issues. Second was the theme of Premature conclusions as students observed that AI lacks self-doubt capacity, whereas human expressions of uncertainty are crucial for learning and collaborative inquiry. For the third theme, Thinking partner with accountability, relational, and distributed expertise benefits, students highlighted social belonging, accountability, and the benefits of distributed intelligence when working with human peers rather than AI. The findings can inform strategies for deploying LLM-chatbots in education, with hopes of preserving the uniquely human aspects of learning conversations and enlightening how LLM-chatbots could augment and not replace these interactions.

					<p><b>Title:</b> Towards Inclusive Representations in Language-Vision Models</p>
					<p><b>Abstract:</b>						
						Solving complex real-world problems often requires AI models that can process information from multiple modalities, such as language and vision, which can align with the needs of people from diverse backgrounds. An effective AI model will not only learn how to interact with humans but also do so in a way that reflects the characteristics of those it interacts with, thereby assisting in everyday life activities and significantly improving our quality of life.
						In this talk, I will address the problem of inclusive representations of AI Multimodal Models. I will challenge the common belief that achieving a "general understanding" is possible solely by using English data from Western countries, and I will show how current language-vision models lead to considerable performance gaps across demographics. Finally, I will highlight insights and actionable steps to address these limitations, such as the development of affordable crowdsourced geo-diverse datasets, or flexible labels that consider the data provider.

					<p><b>Title:</b> Symbols and probability in the age of LLMs</p>

					<p><b>Abstract:</b> LLMs have emerged as a dominant paradigm in the design of systems that interact through text. While the capabilities of LLMs in isolation are astounding, some of the most powerful applications have come from their combination with classical symbolic infrastructure, from calculators to game engines, and probabilistic steering, from importance sampling to variational inference. In this talk, I will highlight how leveraging principles from symbolic and probabilistic computation can yield more robust and reliable systems to interact with the world of text. Across a few case studies from my work, I will present approaches that intersect language models with 1) interactive theorem provers to yield provably accurate logical reasoning, 2) probabilistic programming languages to yield uncertainty-aware semantic parsers, and 3) formal grammars to yield sampling algorithms that cannot introduce syntactic (and some semantic) errors, by design. Across these examples, I will show how these augmentations improve core aspects of performance from accuracy to calibration across an array of tasks and will present several early-stage extensions to this research space.</p>

					<h3> Dan Villarreal </h3>

					<p><b> Time:</b> 11/20/2024, 15:00PM EST - 16:00PM EST</p>
					<p><b> Place:</b> In-person </p>
					<p><b>Bio:</b></p> Dan Villarreal is a computational sociolinguist, as his scholarly work sits at the nexus of two research traditions: bringing together computational methods and sociolinguistic perspectives. In particular, his research seeks to expand sociolinguists' research toolkits by making computational techniques and sociolinguistic data accessible and usable; explore how speakers and listeners make sense of the tremendous phonetic variability that characterizes everyday speech; and foster a computational sociolinguistics (and a linguistics more broadly) that addresses its research questions faster, better, and more equitably. His recent work has investigated computational methods to automatically code sociophonetic variation (and how to make these methods equitable), gender segregation and speech communities in New Zealand, and whether Open Methods in linguistics contribute to academic colonialism. His research has been published in Language Variation and Change, Laboratory Phonology, and Linguistics Vanguard. Dan pronounces his last name /Àåv…™l…ô…πiÀà√¶l/.
					
					<p><b>Title:</b> Corpus sociolinguistics and methodological trade-offs</p>
					
					<p><b>Abstract:</b>
					The troves of speech data that have driven the increasing orientation toward large-scale methods in sociolinguistics and adjacent subfields have been, for the most part, available only to closed teams of researchers and their collaborators. This trend is beginning to change toward open data resources (e.g., Kendall & Farrington 2023; Stanford 2020). However, these resources tend to be narrowly tailored to specific research questions and/or require substantial additional annotation before researchers can realistically address sociolinguistic research questions.
					In this talk, I introduce a soon-to-be released open data resource‚Äîthe Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech (APLS)‚Äîand discuss methodological trade-offs in the process of creating the corpus. As of the time of writing, APLS contains over 32 hours of audio of conversational speech from 34 Pittsburgh English speakers, consisting of over 386,000 word tokens and 900,000 force-aligned segments. (When complete, APLS will include 45 hours of audio from 40 speakers.) Powered by the corpus management software LaBB-CAT (Fromont & Hay 2012), APLS organizes linguistic data into annotation layers that are time-synchronized to speech, from the level of individual speech sounds that may be as short as 30 milliseconds, all the way to the level of entire hourlong interviews. I discuss how the methods for creating the corpus have evolved over the course of the APLS project, such as the introduction of ASR tools for transcription.</p>

			<p><b> Topic:</b> Causal Inference in NLP </p>
			<p><b> Title:</b> Causal Inference for Robust, Reliable, and Responsible NLP </p>
			<p><b>Abstract:</b> Despite the remarkable progress in large language models (LLMs), it is well-known that natural language processing (NLP) models tend to fit for spurious correlations, which can lead to unstable behavior under domain shifts or adversarial attacks. In my research, I develop a causal framework for robust and fair NLP, which investigates the alignment of the causality of human decision-making and model decision-making mechanisms. Under this framework, I develop a suite of stress tests for NLP models across various tasks, such as text classification, natural language inference, and math reasoning; and I propose to enhance robustness by aligning model learning direction with the underlying data generating direction. Using this causal inference framework, I also test the validity of causal and logical reasoning in models, with implications for fighting misinformation, and also extend the impact of NLP by applying it to analyze the causality behind social phenomena important for our society, such as causal analysis of policies, and measuring gender bias in our society. Together, I develop a roadmap towards socially responsible NLP by ensuring the reliability of models, and broadcasting its impact to various social applications. </p>

				<b>Title</b>: Evaluating and Surgically Improving Generalization in Language Models
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Abstract</b>: As language models (LMs) are deployed in wider applications, understanding and controlling how they generalize becomes increasingly important. However, it is difficult to directly evaluate how models are accomplishing the tasks we give them‚Äîand when needed, it is not obvious how to improve generalization on a task without destroying general capabilities. In this talk, I will present two projects that tackle these challenges. I will first present an evaluation of how models process language structure: we evaluate out-of-domain generalization in in-context learning settings, finding that pre-training on code may result in more robust generalization. We also find that chain-of-thought (CoT) results can be misleading: CoT often only improves in-distribution performance without improving out-of-distribution performance. Then, I will present an ongoing mechanistic interpretability effort to isolate and control the algorithms LMs implement via feature circuits. By learning sparse human-interpretable encodings of models‚Äô hidden states (features) and discovering circuits on them, we observe how LMs perform subject-verb agreement: by composing representations of grammatical number in the MLPs and residuals, while detecting and learning to ignore distractor clauses in the attention heads. I will conclude by showing an application of feature circuits‚Äîablating spurious features to improve the generalization of a classifier.

			<p><b>Bio:</b> Ana Marasoviƒá is an Assistant Professor in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah. Her primary research interests are at the confluence of natural language processing (NLP), explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and multimodality. She is interested in projects that (1) rigorously validate AI technologies, and (2) make human interaction with AI more intuitive.
						For an example of robust validation check out her work on carefully designing benchmarks to validate the robustness of QA models in the presence of common linguistic phenomena such as negation or coreference. On the other hand, to help people create a mental model about how to interact with AI, she has contributed to building models that self-explain their predictions in a way that is easily understandable to people, for example by saying why did the model give this answer instead of another one (contrastive explanations) or by telling in plain language the gist of its reasoning (free-text explanations). Moving forward, she is excited to evaluate and improve such models with application-grounded, human-subject evaluations.

					<p>
						<b>Abstract: </b>  The title says it all!  As the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) continues to make incredible strides and advancements, it's important to take a step back and use the past to understand the current transformations.  Drawing from literature and interviews, we'll dive into the early years of NLP and explore some of the major themes, trends, and personalities that paved the way for the cutting-edge technology we have today.

					<p><b> Title:</b> Structured Event Reasoning with Large Language Models </p>
					<p>
						<b>Abstract: </b>  Reasoning about real-life events is a unifying challenge in AI and NLP that has profound utility in a variety of domains, while any fallacy in high-stake applications like law, medicine, and science could be catastrophic. Able to work with diverse text in these domains, large language models (LLMs) have proven capable of answering questions and solving problems. In this talk, I demonstrate that end-to-end LLMs still systematically fail on reasoning tasks of complex events. Moreover, their black-box nature gives rise to little interpretability and user control. To address these issues, I propose two general approaches to use LLMs in conjunction with a structured representation of events. The first is a language-based representation involving relations of sub-events that can be learned by LLMs via fine-tuning. The second is a symbolic representation involving states of entities that can be leveraged by either LLMs or deterministic solvers. On a suite of event reasoning tasks, I show that both approaches outperform end-to-end LLMs in terms of performance and trustworthiness.
